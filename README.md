simple utility to install & delete .gpkg archives with binary files.

usage: installgpkg [options] [file ...]

          -h  --help      print this usage and exit
          -i  --install   install package
          -d  --delete    delete package

I was too lazy to follow portage standards or make a gentoo binhost, so i wrote this, maybe someone could use this.
